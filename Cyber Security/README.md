Project Name:

Cyber Security August Major Project

Project Description:
1. Perform Scanning Module by using Nmap tool (Download from Internet) and scan kalilinux and
Windows 7 machine and find the open/closed ports and services running on machine
Hacker Machine : Windows 10
Victim machine : Kali Linux and Windows 7
2. Test the System Security by using metasploit Tool from kali linux and hack the windows 7 / win
dows10. Execute the commands to get the keystrokes / screenshots / Webcam and etc., Write
a report on vulnerability issue along with screenshots how you performed and suggest th
security patch to avoid these type of attacks
Hacker Machine : Kali Linux
Victim machine : Windows XP / Windows 7
3. Use SET Tool and create a fake Gmail page and try to capture the credentials in command line
and
Hacker Machine : Kali Linux
Victim machine : Windows XP / Windows 7 / Windows 10
4. Install Social Phish tool from GitHub and try to execute the tool for phishing page and perfrom
in lab setup only
5. Perform SQL injection Manually on http://testphp.vulnweb.com Write a report along with

6. Crack the password of windows machine by using ophcrack tool in virtual machine on windows
7 and try get the password, along with that mention the path of SAM file in windows and and

7. Write an Article on cybersecurity and recent attacks which you came across in media and news
and research on that news, and explain the any topic which you learned in this course and mention
what you learned

Note:
1. Write a Document with on each task along with screenshots and after attack mention the
solutions to avoid those attacks
2. Use Only Virtual Machines to perform the tasks
3. Don’t try these attacks on real-time environment, we won’t be responsible for any misuse
4. Create a New lab with all the Operating system and practice on that
5. Refer Internet resources for solutions and complete the project within given date.
